# Civic-Snap
Civic Engagement: "Citizen Reporter (FixMyCity)" The Problem: Local issues like potholes, broken streetlights, or uncollected trash often go unreported because the process to contact city council is tedious.The Solution: A progressive web app (PWA) allowing users to snap a photo of an issue, automatically tag the GPS location.
